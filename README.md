This code defines a StudentGradeManager class that allows a user to input student grades, calculate the average grade, determine the letter grade, and display the results in a formatted summary. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of its functionality:

__init__: Initializes an empty dictionary grades to store subject-grade pairs.

input_grades: Collects grades from the user for each subject in a loop until 'exit' is entered. For each subject, it prompts for a grade, storing it in the grades dictionary after validating that it is a float.

calculate_average: Computes the average of the grades stored in grades. If there are no grades, it returns 0.

determine_letter_grade: Maps the numerical average to a letter grade based on a standard grading scale (A-F).

display_results: Prints a summary of each subject and grade, as well as the calculated average and letter grade.

main function: Creates an instance of StudentGradeManager, calls input_grades to gather data, and then displays the summary using display_results.

When the program is executed, it runs main, which initiates the grading process.
